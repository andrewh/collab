# Collaboration Guide for Agents

This repo contains all my collaboration notes and instructions for agents, such as Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Amp, etc.

It is designed to be a public repo and consumed live by agents I'm working with.

## Quick Start

For a fresh container or VM:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewh/collab.git
cd collab && ./dotfiles/install.sh
```

See [claude-code/setup.md](claude-code/setup.md) for wiring guides into existing projects.

## Goals

- agent session setup is consistent across projects and agents
- improvements are saved and compounded for future sessions
