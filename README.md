# Collaboration Guide for Agents

This repo contains all my collaboration notes and instructions for agents, such as Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Amp, etc.

It is designed to be a public repo and consumed live by agents I'm working with.

## Goals

- agent session setup is consistent across projects and agents
- improvements are saved and compounded for future sessions
