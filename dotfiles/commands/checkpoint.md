@description Commit current work, update tracking, and summarise status.

## 1. Check state

Run `git status` and `git diff --stat` to see what's changed.

## 2. Commit

If there are uncommitted changes, commit them with a clear message describing the current state. Split into multiple commits if the changes cover different areas.

If the changes aren't ready to commit on the current branch, suggest creating a WIP branch.

## 3. Update tracking

Review the todo list. Mark completed items as done. Add any new items discovered during work. Note anything that's blocked.

## 4. Summarise

Report:
- What's been done since the last checkpoint
- What's in progress
- What's next
- Any blockers or open questions
- Current branch and commit
