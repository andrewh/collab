@description Fight instruction drift on long sessions. Re-read rules and re-orient.

This session has been running for a while. Re-ground yourself before continuing.

## 1. Re-read the rules

Read the project's CLAUDE.md file. Read your global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md. Note any rules that apply to your current work.

## 2. Check your todo list

Review all tasks. Are any marked in-progress that are actually done? Are there tasks you've forgotten about? Is the current task still the right priority?

## 3. Check git state

Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -5`. Are there uncommitted changes that should be committed? Are you on the right branch?

## 4. Summarise

Report:
- Current task and its status
- Any rules from CLAUDE.md particularly relevant to current work
- Git state
- Any concerns or things that feel off

Then continue with the current task.
