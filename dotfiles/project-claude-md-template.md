# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- Build: `TODO`
- Test all: `TODO`
- Test single: `TODO`
- Lint: `TODO`
- Format: `TODO`

## Architecture

<!-- Brief description of how the main components connect. 2-5 sentences.
     e.g. "Express API server with React frontend. API routes are in src/routes/,
     business logic in src/services/, database access in src/repositories/." -->

## Conventions

<!-- Project-specific conventions that aren't obvious from the code.
     e.g. error handling patterns, config loading, naming conventions,
     where new files of a given type should go. -->

## Gotchas

<!-- Things that will bite you if you're not warned.
     e.g. generated files that look editable, tests needing specific setup,
     confusingly similar package names, fragile areas. -->
